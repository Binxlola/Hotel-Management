# About HotelManagement
This project is aimed to at providing a hotel management application that is fully encompassing of the customer and staff functionality that one would expect from such an application on either side.
The application is build using Node JS with the client side taking advantage of the Angular framework, and the backend being built with express.
The design of the application is made to feel sleek and modern, as well maintaining simplicity in its usage.

## Client Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## API Development server
In a separate terminal to which the client server has been served. run 'npm run express' or 'npm run expressDev' depending on the environment being used.
When in a development environment and using the command 'npm run expressDev', the API server will automatically reload if any changes are detected.
